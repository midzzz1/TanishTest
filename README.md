Answer 1<br>
Front-end:<br>
User Interface (UI): The user interface is the main component of a website or web application's front end.
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript are some of the components it contains. 
These technologies are in charge of designing the visual aesthetic, organising and presenting the material, and executing client-side interactive behaviour.
Web browser: Users use the web browser software programme to visit websites and web applications.
It receives HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from the server, interprets them, and then renders them into a visual interface that users can interact with.
Back-end:<br>
Server: The server-side components are referred to as the back-end of the internet.
Powerful computers called servers handle and store data, as well as reply to client requests. 
They are capable of running a variety of software programmes, including web servers (such as Apache or Nginx) and application servers (such as Node.js, Python Django, and Ruby on Rails).
Servers handle activities like managing user sessions, processing business logic, and storing data.
Databases: To store and handle data, back-end systems frequently use databases.
Databases make it possible to store, retrieve, and modify data in a systematic way. Databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis are often used. 
The back-end server issues queries and commands that give access to and control over these databases.


Answer 2<br>
The elements on a web page are organised and defined using tags in HTML. 
Based on their functionality and intended use, they can be categorised and are enclosed within angle brackets ( and >).
The following list of typical HTML tag types is accompanied by succinct justifications and examples:
Headings: Headings are used to define the titles and subtitles of sections on a webpage. 
There are six levels of headings, from  (the most important) to (the least important). 
Example:Welcome to My Website

Paragraphs: Paragraph tags are used to enclose blocks of text. 
  They create a new paragraph with proper spacing. Example: <p> This is a paragraph of text.</p>

Links: Link tags are used to create clickable links to other web pages or resources. 
They are created with the <a> tag and require an href attribute specifying the target URL.
Example: <a> Example</a>

Images: Image tags are used to embed images into a webpage. 
They are created with the <img> tag and require a src attribute specifying the image file URL.

Lists: Lists are used to present information in an ordered or unordered manner.
  
 Answer 3<br>
  Simply put, the virtual DOM is a representation of a DOM object.
  In React JS, every DOM element has a corresponding Virtual DOM Object.
  No doubt that the virtual DOM has the same properties as we have in the normal DOM object but unlike the DOM object where we can directly change what is on the screen, 
  we cannot do that for the virtual DOM.
  For every update done on the Virtual DOM, React compares the Virtual DOM with a snapshot of the initial state before the update was done.
  So, with the help of this comparison done by react js, it automatically figures out which part of your react component needs to be updated. 
  Interestingly, React uses what we call the diffing algorithm to do this and the process of using this diffing algorithm is called diffing.
  So once reacts compares, it then updates the components which need to be updated with the updated nodes.
  When the DOM receives an update, it changes only the content of the DOM as we can find in the second block of code.
  This update is so fast that we donâ€™t usually know when this happens.
  It only marks the component which needs to be updated and updates it for us.
  
  
 
  Answer 4<br>
  MySQL<br>
  MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) based on a structured data model. 
  It uses tables with rows and columns to organize and store data. 
  Data is stored in a pre-defined schema, and relationships between tables are established through primary and foreign keys.
  
  NoSQL<br>
  NoSQL databases use a variety of data models, such as key-value, document, columnar, and graph, depending on the specific NoSQL database system.
  NoSQL databases provide flexibility in data representation and allow for dynamic schema changes. 
  They do not require rigid table structures or predefined relationships.
  
  
  
  Answer 5<br>
  MongoDB stores data in flexible, self-describing documents using the BSON (Binary JSON) format. 
  Each document can have a different structure, allowing for dynamic schema and easy modification of data without strict table structures.
  MongoDB supports field, range, and regular-expression queries which can return entire documents, specific fields of documents, or random samples of results.
